# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF SPOTIFY SONGS 

Music streaming platforms such as Spotify generate extensive datasets that explore various audio features such as danceability, tempo, valence, etc. This project analyzes Spotify song data to explore how audio features vary across artists and genres and observes any relationships between them. By combining descriptive statistics and visual analysis, this project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to understand patterns in modern music.

## Overview

This exploratory data analysis answers these three research questions: 
1. Which artists produce the highest-energy music on average, and how does energy relate to loudness?
2. Is there a relationship between a song’s emotional positivity (valence) and its danceability?
3. How does tempo vary across different Spotify playlist genres?

### Interesting Insight 

Do certain songs make you extremely happy, but others do the exact oppposite? This can be explained by the valence of the song. 

Valence of a song: The word valence is most commonly used in chemistry, but it is also linked to music. Its defined as the musical positiveness of a song and is measured from 0 to 1. 

In this project, we explore how valence is related to the danceability of a song and check whether happier songs are more danceable.

## Current Plan

GOALS:

1. We want to be able to use R to find patterns, trends, relationships over time, etc. and make statistical observations from any given data.

2. We want to be able to apply the knowledge gained throughout this course to use real-life data and create visualizations.

3. We want to develop an organized and well-formatted project.

4. We want to refine our teamwork and leadership skills by working together efficiently.

NEEDS:

1. RStudio
   
2. Github
   
3. Dataset that we select

4. Knowledge and skills gained from this course

5. Group chat for clear communication
   
6. Necessary packages in R

STEPS:

1. Browse to find potential datasets we could use.

2. Pick the final dataset by voting on it.

3. Observe patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

4. Brainstorm ideas of possible visualizations, inferences, etc.

5. Pick final ideas for project by voting on it.

6. Assign roles to each person.

7. Complete our assigned goals.

8. Work together to create the repo for our project.

MEMBER 1:

1. Load dataset and necessary packages into R.

2. Clean the data until it can be used further.

3. Write a project report detailing what was done and how it was accomplished.

MEMBER 2:

1. Perform data analysis and get summary of data.

2. Use R to create necessary visualizations such as well-formatted tables, graphs, charts, etc.

3. Write a project report detailing what was done and how it was accomplished.

MEMBER 3:

1. Create a QMD file that includes all visualizations and any necessary information about the project.

2. Write a project report detailing what was done and how it was accomplished.

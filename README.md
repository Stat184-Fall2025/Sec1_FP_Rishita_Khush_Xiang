# Project Title

Write a 1-2 sentences that quickly and clearly convey what your repo is for.

## Overview

Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

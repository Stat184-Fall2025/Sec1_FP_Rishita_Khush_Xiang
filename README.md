# Project Title

Write a 1-2 sentences that quickly and clearly convey what your repo is for.

## Overview

Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Current Plan

GOALS:

We want to be able to use R to find patterns, trends, relationships over time, etc. and make statistical observations from any given data.

We want to be able to apply the knowledge gained throughout this course to use real-life data and create visualizations.

We want to develop an organized and well-formatted project.

We want to refine our teamwork and leadership skills by working together efficiently.

NEEDS:

1. RStudio
   
2. Github
   
3. Dataset that we select

4. Knowledge and skills gained from this course

Observe patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

Brainstorm ideas of possible visualizations, inferences, etc.

Pick final ideas for project by voting on it.

Assign roles to each person.

Complete our assigned goals.

Work together to create the repo for our project.

MEMBER 1:

Load dataset and necessary packages into R.

Clean the data until it can be used further.
